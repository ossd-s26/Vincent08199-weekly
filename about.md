My name is Xiancheng (Vincent) Su. I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Real Estate Development.

My interests focus on cryptocurrencies, blockchain infrastructure, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.

During the summer and fall, I work at [Summit Ventures](https://summit.ventures/), a real estate private equity firm.
