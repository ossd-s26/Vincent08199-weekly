title: "Week 1: What Open Source Means to Me"
---

When I first heard the term *open source*, it was not from a computer science class, but from playing PC games like Minecraft. In the Minecraft community, there is a strong culture of mods and modpacks, many of which are created and shared freely by players on the internet. These community contributions make the game more creative and enjoyable. 

Because of experiences like this, I started to think of the internet itself as a large open source ecosystem — a place where people can share ideas, build on each other’s work, and collectively push technology forward.

## Open Source vs Closed Source

One of the biggest advantages of open source software is transparency. Anyone can inspect the code, learn from it, and improve it. This creates faster innovation and allows communities to fix bugs and improve performance much more quickly than a closed development environment.

Open source also lowers barriers to entry. Students, independent developers, and researchers can all access powerful tools without expensive licenses. Many of the technologies that power today’s internet infrastructure are open source.

However, open source is not perfect. One major concern is security. Because the code is public, malicious actors can study it to find vulnerabilities. Another challenge is that ideas and code can be copied without proper credit. Maintaining high-quality open source projects also requires long-term community effort, which is not always guaranteed.

## Why I Chose This Course

I decided to enroll in this course because I am interested in Web3, blockchain infrastructure, and cryptocurrency ecosystems. Most major crypto and blockchain projects are open source. The security and trust models in these systems depend heavily on public code review and community contributions.

Understanding how open source communities function is important not only for software development, but also for building decentralized systems and financial infrastructure in the future.

## Open Source Projects That Influenced Me

### Linux
Linux is one of the most important open source operating systems. It powers servers, cloud infrastructure, and many developer environments. Using Linux helped me understand how operating systems and system-level tools work.

### Python
Python is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and automation. I personally use Python for data visualization and scripting tasks. Its open source ecosystem allows developers to build and share powerful libraries.

### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a widely used code editor developed by Microsoft. While not fully open source in distribution, it is built on open source components and has a strong open extension ecosystem. It has influenced how I write and organize code.

### Git
Git is the industry standard distributed version control system. It allows developers to track changes, collaborate efficiently, and maintain project history. In most computer science courses, Git and GitHub are essential tools for collaboration and software development.

## Final Thoughts

Open source is not just about code — it is about collaboration, transparency, and shared progress. As technology becomes more global and interconnected, open source communities will continue to play a critical role in innovation and knowledge sharing.
