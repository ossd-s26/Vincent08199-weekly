title: Week 2 – Codes of Conduct, Consensus, and Trust in Open Source
---

## Open Source as a Social System

This week’s materials reinforced the idea that open source projects are not sustained by code alone, but by shared norms and communication practices. While code enables collaboration, it is social agreements—such as Codes of Conduct and transparent decision-making processes—that determine whether a community can function and grow sustainably.

## Codes of Conduct as Social Agreements

After reading [the Code of Conduct for the Go Project](https://go.dev/conduct) and comparing it with shared templates such as the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/), I began to view Codes of Conduct less as legal documents and more as *social agreements*. They do not carry legal force, and violating them does not result in legal punishment. Instead, they represent a collective commitment by contributors who voluntarily follow shared expectations in order to improve the community.

In the case of Go, these expectations align closely with the language’s broader engineering philosophy, which prioritizes clarity, simplicity, and collective responsibility over individual expression. Compared to the Contributor Covenant, Go’s Code of Conduct is more concise and engineering-oriented, suggesting that such documents should be adapted to reflect the culture and governance of a specific project rather than copied verbatim.

## Comparing Different Project Approaches

Looking at other projects further highlights this adaptability. The [Eclipse Foundation Code of Conduct](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php) is more formal and structured, which aligns with its role as a large foundation supporting enterprise-level and corporate-backed projects. In contrast, the [Sugar Labs Code of Conduct](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Legal/Code_of_Conduct) is embedded within its legal and community documentation and emphasizes safety, learning, and mentorship, reflecting its educational mission.

These differences demonstrate that while many projects draw inspiration from common templates, the final structure and tone of a Code of Conduct often mirror a project’s audience, scale, and long-term goals.

## Consensus, Transparency, and Everyday Practice

The presentation *How to Drive Consensus and Transparency Within Open Source Communities* connected these documents to real collaboration practices. Concepts such as active listening, documenting decisions, and seeking “rough consensus” emphasize that disagreement is a natural part of collaborative work. What matters is whether discussions remain open, respectful, and transparent.

Transparency helps prevent hidden decision-making and builds trust among contributors. In this sense, consensus-driven processes and Codes of Conduct work together: both aim to reduce power imbalances and ensure that contributors feel heard throughout the decision-making process.

## Personal Reflection

This perspective made me reflect on a mistake I made in my Agile Development course. I once created a pull request and approved it myself, treating the review process as a formality rather than a meaningful checkpoint. While this did not violate any explicit rule, it went against the spirit of collaboration.

This experience showed me that collaborative norms only work when participants respect not just the written rules, but the intent behind them. Processes such as peer review exist not to slow development, but to create shared responsibility and trust within a team.

## Conclusion

Overall, this week reinforced the idea that open source communities depend on more than technical skill. They are sustained by voluntary social agreements, transparent communication, and a shared commitment to respectful collaboration. Although Codes of Conduct may not be legally binding, their power lies in the fact that contributors choose to follow them in order to build communities that last. Understanding these norms early has reshaped how I approach collaboration, not only in open source projects, but in any team-based technical environment.
