title: "Week 3: Working on Our First Open Source Project"
---

This week marked the first time I actively participated in building an open source project as part of a team. Instead of only learning concepts, we began applying open source practices through collaboration, discussion, and early design decisions.

Our project idea is **QuickDelete**, a browser extension that allows users to delete their browsing data with a single click. The goal is to make privacy protection simple and accessible for everyday users.

## Project Collaboration and Team Roles

Working in a group helped me better understand how open source projects are shaped by collaboration rather than individual effort. Each team member contributed in different ways. One teammate focused on proposing the core idea and basic functionality, while another explored extending features and AI-related usability.

My main contribution was helping define the project scope and user workflow. I focused on clarifying what “one-click delete” should actually remove, such as browsing history, cookies, cache, and other site data, and how the extension should behave in real daily use. This helped turn the initial idea into a clearer and more concrete project direction.

## Challenges and Progress

One challenge we faced was aligning our ideas early on. Everyone had slightly different assumptions about what the extension should do, which required discussion and compromise. However, these conversations were productive and helped us better understand the importance of clear communication in open source projects.

A positive outcome was seeing how quickly ideas evolved once we talked through them together. Even without writing much code yet, we made meaningful progress by refining the concept and ensuring it was realistic and user-friendly.

## What I Learned From the Process

After contributing to the initial idea and scope of the project, I realized that I often hesitate once an idea is proposed. I tend to worry about whether the idea is good enough, who the target users are, and whether the project will actually be useful. This made me more cautious and less confident at first.

However, through working with the team, I learned that many of these concerns can only be addressed by actually building and testing the idea. In open source projects, progress often comes from doing rather than overthinking. This experience helped me understand that taking action and iterating is more important than waiting for a perfect plan.

## Final Thoughts

Working on our first open source project helped me better understand how collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility shape successful projects. As we continue developing QuickDelete, I am looking forward to contributing further and seeing how the project grows through teamwork.
